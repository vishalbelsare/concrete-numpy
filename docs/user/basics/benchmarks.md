# Benchmarks

To track **Concrete Numpy** features, performance, and related metrics progress over time, we will make benchmark trackers available at a later date.

Ideally the trackers will be tracking:
- targets that we want to compile
- status of the compilability of these functions
- evaluation times on various hardware configurations
- accuracy of the functions (when it makes sense)
- loss and other metrics of the functions (when it makes sense)

Note that these are preliminary ideas; more information (e.g., key generation time, encryption time, inference time, decryption time, etc.) can be added once the related APIs are available.

If there are benchmarks you would like to see in the progress tracker or if there are metrics you would like to see tracked once the benchmarks are made public, don't hesitate to drop an email to <hello@zama.ai>.
